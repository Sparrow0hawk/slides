# Presentation slides repository

## Requirements for local use

To use this repository locally you will need [`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/) to compile `.scss` to `.css` if you wish to edit the stylesheets. 
To do this you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Node package manager (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/), I'd recommend doing this via something like [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Once you've installed Node.js and NPM you can install [`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/) with:

```bash
$ npm install -g sass
```
